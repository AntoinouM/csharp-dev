## OOP

### Struct
- Struct is a constrained version of a class

### Method
- Methods are used to execute statements.
  * Constructor

## Accessibility Levels
* Depending on the context in which a member declaration occurs.
  * public / protected / internal / private ...
  
### Access Modifier of Class
  * The class accessibility (private / public...) allow you to access the class when calling it on an instance (object)

### Common Advices
  * Use class often and sometimes struct
    * See the difference between both in slide 28

### Function overloading
* Create different function / methods with the same name that will produce a different result regarding the type/parameter it receive)
  
### Indexers
* Research this
  * Use an indexer to retrieve a specific Instance of a Class (Cat.childlist[indexOfChildren]) => return the specified Cat

# Data Structure

1. Ways to roganize data

- Different data structures lead to differtent ways to solve a given problem (algorithm)
- Different algorithms ,ay give different efficiency (space and time)

## Algorithms and Application
- Every computer...

## Different datastructure type

### Array / List / Linked List

#### Array
An array has fixed size, usually quicker to research through
A List is better to get item from

- Storing data in a sequential memory location
- Access eahc eleet using integer index
- Very basic, popular and simple
```csharp
Int[] myArray = new int[] {a,b,c,d};
```
- Store the elements in a continous way

##### Array problems
- New insertion and deletion: difficult
- Need to shift to make space for insertion
- Need to fill empty positions after deletion

Two extensions exist: Dynamic Array(=List in C#) and Linked List.
