<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
First assignement of the C# development class. Introduction to algorithms through -Bubble and -Merge sort.


### Built With

* [![Visual Studio Code]][[https://code.visualstudio.com/]
* [!.NET][https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Prerequisites

* Having an IDE
* Having .NET 6.0 SDK installed <!-- link in Built with above -->
    * if .NET is installed, use the command 'dotnet --list-sdks' to check your version.
* Not mixing Durian with Blue cheese on a pizza (or anywhere).

### Installation

1. Download the source file (.zip file)
2. Extract the code
3. Open the folder that contain the extracted code in your IDE
<!-- The next step are for VS code, if you use another IDE please refer to the documentation -->
4. Open a new terminal for the project Terminal > New Terminal.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This Program is used to sort numbers(int, float and double) or string provided by the user. The two implemented algorithms are Bubble sort and Merge sort.

You input your number and the method you prefer like this:

dotnet run sort -Bubble -int "38,27,43,3,9,82,10"
or
dotnet run sort -Merge -string "banana,apple,kiwi,pear"

And you will have this output:
"After sort: 3 9 10 27 38 43 82".
or
"After sort: apple banana kiwi pear".

The program handle misuage by providing the correct formating for the input.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] A Program to sort numbers or strings in ascending order
    - [ ] Bubble sort algorithm
    - [ ] Merge sort algorithm

See the [github repo](https://github.com/AntoinouM/csharp-dev) for a full overview of the code.
