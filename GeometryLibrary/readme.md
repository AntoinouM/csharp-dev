<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Third assignement of the C# development class. Advanced introduction to classes, inheritance and light introduction to basic geometry.


### Built With

* [![Visual Studio Code]][[https://code.visualstudio.com/]
* [!.NET][https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Prerequisites

* Having an IDE
* Having .NET 6.0 SDK installed <!-- link in Built with above -->
    * if .NET is installed, use the command 'dotnet --list-sdks' to check your version.

### Installation

1. Download the source file (.zip file)
2. Extract the code
3. Open the folder that contain the extracted code in your IDE
<!-- The next step are for VS code, if you use another IDE please refer to the documentation -->
4. Open a new terminal for the project Terminal > New Terminal.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This Program is a built as a simple library to represents shapes (cylinders, cuboids and tetrahedrons) in a 3D space with attached methods to calculate related propreties.

If you want to use the library, all the points should be order following this comvention:

```
     8_________________________ 7
     /|                       /| 
   5/_|____________________6_/ | 
    | |                     |  | 
    | |_4___________________|__| 3
    | /                     | /  
    |/______________________|/
    1                       2
```

Your input would be 'dotnet run' or 'dotnet run -thread' and the program will display all the surfaces of the 15 pre-coded shapes in the terminal.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] A library for geometrics shapes in a 3D space.
    - [ ] SShape abstract class
    - [ ] Tetrahedrons class
    - [ ] Cuboids class
    - [ ] Cylinders class

See the [github repo](https://github.com/AntoinouM/csharp-dev) for a full overview of the code.
